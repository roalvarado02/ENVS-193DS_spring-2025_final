# Problem 1: Research Writing

## a. Transparent statistical methods

In part 1, they used a Pearson correlation test to compare two continuous variables. A value of 0.03 is lower than the 0.05 significance threshold meaning there is a significant linear relationship between the variables, so they rejected the null hypothesis. 

In part 2, they used a one-way ANOVA test to compare a continuous variable to five categorical groups. The test was able to check if at least one group mean was significantly different from the others, and the p=0.02 indicated there was a difference so the null hypothesis was rejected.

## b. More information needed

Part 2 could include effect size such as Cohen's f to show how large the difference is. They could also use a Post-hoc pairwise comparison to determine which categorical groups are significantly different from each other.

## c. Suggestions for rewriting

Part 1: We found a significant positive relationship between distance from headwaters and annual total nitrogen load, suggesting that nitrogen accumulates downstream (Pearson correlation test, r = correlation coefficient, p = 0.03, α = 0.05). 

Part 2: Average nitrogen load differed significantly across source types, with higher loads from fertilizer and wastewater treatment sources compared to grasslands and urban land.
(One-way ANOVA, F = test statistic, df = degrees of freedom, p = 0.02, α = 0.05; post-hoc pairwise differences; effect size). 

# Problem 2: Data Visualization 

## a.

```{r}

sst_clean <- sst |>
  clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    date = ymd(date),                   
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(year, month) |>
  summarise(mean_monthly_sst = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

slice_sample(sst_clean, n = 5)

str(sst_clean)


```
